All of the motifs are painted in a ruby luster on a white background. The back of the dish is ornamented with four luster spirals. Such non-figural designs were extremely popular in the fifteenth century, when Italian potters sought to replicate the abstract designs and luster glazes exhibited on imported Spanish and Middle-Eastern ceramics. However, the popularity of these motifs declined during the early sixteenth century, as potters began to favor “istoriato” wares that depicted imagery from Classical or Biblical narratives. This dish was likely produced in a workshop in Gubbio, a city with maiolica painters that were well-known for their luster glazes. For more on luster glazes, see 48.1320; for general information on “maiolica,” see 48.1336.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=\"https://art.thewalters.org/detail/22\" rel=\"external alternate main\">plates</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>",

Their skin is white, but their facial features, eroded or rubbed away, are indistinguishable. Each wears a helmet, holds a long spear and has a horizontal quiver. The middle figure holds both hands near her waist; the other two have one hand raised.\n\nAmazons are first mentioned in the \"Iliad\" (6.186) as allies of the Trojans; later authors emphasize their fearlessness and their status as foreigners. They were introduced on Attic vases in the early 6th century BC, and quickly became a  popular subject. Early black-figure depictions of Amazons resemble Greek warriors, with one notable difference-their white skin color, which identifies them as \"women.\" In red-figure vases, the Amazons acquire more feminine features and bodies, and their foreigness is emphasized by their attire: Scythian or Thracian clothing and subsequently Persian garb. \n\nIn some places in Greece, Amazons were the object of cult. Jennifer Larson (1995, 111-16) has suggested that despite the fact that they were considered hostile to the Greeks, their complete otherness from the Greek way of life also gave them protective powers and entitled them to be worshiped as heroines.</p><p>For the latest information about this object, <cite><a href=\"https://art.thewalters.org/detail/62\" rel=\"external alternate main\">lekythoi; vases</a></cite>, visit art.thewalters.org.</p>",
