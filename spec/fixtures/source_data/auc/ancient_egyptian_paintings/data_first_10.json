      "Discovered by Vassalli in 1870, this painting was one of the first objects to find a place in the Cairo collection. It is also the earliest specimen of Egyptian pictorial art reproduced in the present work, and such is the mastery of its execution, such the craftsman's command of his materials, that it might well stand at the apex of the long centuries of achievement rather than at their base. The birds are closer to nature in their colouring than those of the later golden age of painting at Thebes, and for adequate comparison we must turn to the naturalistic art of El-Amarna (Plates LXXV, LXXVI). Similar processions of brown and grey geese, waddling along the canal banks of black mud fringed by the same variety of flowering rush, may be seen to-day by the wayfarer on the road from Giza to Medun; indeed, four of the geese might have been copied directly from their modem descendants. Three species are depicted, the White-fronted goose (Anser albifrons or erythropus, compare Plate VI), the Bean goose (Anser fabalis), and the Red­ breasted goose (Branta ruficollis). Such at least was Nicoll's opinion, but it is not easy to follow his distinction of the former two. The Red-breasted goose is no longer found in Egypt, though recorded as having been seen there as recently as 1874; the present habitat is northern Siberia. The flowers of the rush are brownish-yellow in reality, not bright red as in the picture. Subtler shades are used than we find elsewhere in Egyptian painting. Black mixed with white has produced grey, and mixed with red has produced a dull pink. Black has also been combined with yellow and red to form a dark brown, while shading with fine lines adds new tones to the feathers. The stippling of light red on the legs has yielded a far brighter tint than if the color had been applied opaquely, as upon the breasts. Though treated conventionally, the geese exhibit all essential details, and it is astonishing to find such fidelity to nature in work anterior to the Pyramids and going back almost five thousand years. Nothing so accomplished is known from the same date beyond the borders of Egypt. That the Medum geese were not an entirely isolated tour deforce on the part of their author is shown by the fragment of a gazelle from the same tomb; this is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and is of extreme delicacy in both drawing and coloring. But hardly any other Old Kingdom site has produced paintings of comparable excellence."

Here, however, the grey film is not so thick, and damage has been avoided owing to the great distance from the ground. The background is of a stronger blue-grey than elsewhere in the tomb. The red on the tails of two birds and on the tree-trunk has disintegrated as a result of the admixture of black to give a deeper tone."

    "description-of-plate": [
      "Part of a very large scene in which the prince Khnemhotpe was represented, accompanied by his son and his treasurer, pulling in a clap-net full of birds over a pool in the marshes (compare Plate XLVIII). He is shown seated on the left and hidden by a screen made of reeds and pierced with peepholes at intervals. A portion of this screen comes into our excerpt, as well as an angle of the net (top right, enclosing two of the trapped ducks), and also the left edge of the water. The acacia tree here given balances another on the right side of the clap-net that has been reproduced in colour elsewhere. The tree in question is frequently seen in the villages and way-sides of Egypt; the modem Arabic name is sun/ , and it is popularly called 'mimosa' by Europeans. Here it is painted much more faithfully than in Plate XCVII (Dyn. XIX), and is shown flowering instead of seeding, the sweet-scented little yellow balls being distributed amongst the delicate pale-green foliage decoratively arranged around the brownish stems. The pale-yellow mid-rib of the leaf adds to the light effect of the whole. The birds which perch in the branches are such as are said to inhabit the sunt, and, like this, show a fairly close resemblance to nature. The hoopoe (Upttpa epops major) is common in Egypt to-day, but its tail is square and not forked as in the picture, and the crest is erect only in flight. The bird with spread wings and the one above it are both shrikes (Lanius nubicus). Next below is a Red-backed shrike (Lanius colurio), and standing under the tree on the right is a red­ start (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), but with blue substituted for grey. These last species are rare at the present time, and are seldom depicted in the ancient paintings. At the bottom on the right ducks, still unsnared, swim about among the water-plants.\r\nThe whole composition is too large to admit of reproduction in its entirety. Both colour and details are extraordinarily fine, and the picture occupies a worthy place between the Medum geese (Plate I) and the El-Amama wall decorations (Plates LXXV, LXXVI)."

      "This and the four following pictures are taken from the tomb of one of the great feudal princes of the Oryx nome or province in Middle Egypt. His magnificent tomb, hewn out of the solid limestone in the hills of the east bank, is one of the finest in Egypt. An immense variety of subjects is illustrated upon the walls. The present picture comes from a series representing the work in Khnemhotpe’s orchards and vineyards. The artist has here, as in Plate VIII, produced sadly contorted forms in his endeavour to show the men with both shoulders. The fig-tree and baboons are much more satisfactorily rendered. It is unusual to find a genuine fig-tree instead of the sycamore commonly pictured in Egyptian paintings, but the artist has treated it as if it were quite familiar to him. The baboons have been held to be Cynocephalus babuin, but owing to the absence of the mane are possibly of the species Cynocephalus anubis, sometimes known from its colouring as the olive baboon, though this is now confined to West Africa. The animals are eating their fill, and were probably pets, as otherwise the men would hardly have submitted to such plundering. Nor is it likely that they then existed in Egypt in the wild state. The kneeling man on the right is packing the ripe figs in a wooden box with cords for suspension from a yoke to be slung over the shoulders."

The physiognomy and dress of himself and his companions are utterly different from those of the Egyptians depicted in the same tomb. He has a water-skin slung upon his back, and uses a plectrum to play his lyre. The shoulders are even more distorted than elsewhere in the tomb, whose artists always had trouble with this feature (Plates VII, VIII, X). The sandals seem to be made of thongs of leather. The patient-looking donkey has a gay-looking saddle-cloth, to which are tied a throw-stick, a spear, and at top some object not easy to identify. The zebra-stripe on the shoulder, so characteristic of the ass, has not been forgotten. The awkward drawing of the man detracts little from the great interest of the picture."

      "These women belong, as the inscription accompanying the scene tells us, to a party of 'thirty-seven 'Aamu-people ' who 'came bringing eye-paint' to the prince Khnemhotpe. Their appearance proclaims their Semitic origin, and their home may have been in the south of Palestine. Only fifteen are actually shown, including the prince Ebsha and the children; the man and donkey in Plate XI immediately follow the women. These have curious bird-like faces with very hooked noses and light eyes. Their irises, unlike those of the Egyptians, are light grey outlined in black, and show a small black pupil similar to those of the Syrians of Plate XLII. They are more substantially dressed than Egyptian women, and their garments suggest woven fabrics. The dress of the third woman differs from that of the rest in having a rounded neck-line instead of leaving one shoulder bare, and the key-pattern is very unusual. The socks or boots are unlike the thonged sandals of the men. The boy in front of the group is very badly drawn; the arm with the hand bearing the spear is in an absurd position, while the other is entirely lacking. No artistic merit can be ascribed to the picture, and its interest lies in the exceptional subject and in the details."

      "This fragment from the tomb of Hatshepsut's Chief Steward, who built her famous temple at Der el-Bahri, is of great historic interest on account of its faithful representation of Cretan Minoans and their tribute. At the death of the queen, Senmut fell from power and his tomb seems to have been intentionally wrecked, so that hardly anything is now left of its scenes. The Plate shows in its present condition no small fraction of what remains. Much damage has been done by exposure to the weather, and the black locks, almost hanging to the waist, that were seen by the early copyists, have completely disappeared. An unsuccessful attempt by modem robbers to cut out some of the vases was fortunately abandoned in time. The small separate fragment comes from farther to the left, where the procession of tribute-bearers is continued under a frieze of Hathor-heads and a band of inscription. The beardless faces and red colour of the men are characteristic; no less than the richly ornamented skirts with their peculiar codpieces, elsewhere misinterpreted as quivers. It is impossible to tell whether these skirts were embroidered or woven in colours. The vases, absurdly exaggerated in size, raise many problems. If the two of the Vaphio type were of silver, as their colour seems to imply, how was the ornamentation upon them achieved? The purplish bands and scrolls on the one, and the bands and part of the oxen's heads on the other, were originally black, as some few remaining fragments show. For similar bucrania see Plate XXII. An inlay upon silver of yellow, blue, red, and black seems im­probable, and one is tempted to believe that these cups represent painted pottery. But would painted pottery have been valuable enough to be depicted as tribute? To this question it might, how­ ever, be answered that the two red vases certainly suggest earthen­ ware both by their form and by their colour. The ewer on the right may well have been of silver and gold, since its rope pattern is common in metal-work."

The pet animal sits quietly under her mistress's chair on the usual mat of green papyrus. A string is attached to the gay collar, but it has evidently been found unnecessary to tie the animal to the leg of the chair as was done to the cat of Plate XXVII. A similar collar of coloured leather-work is preserved in the Cairo Museum, and all dogs wore such. The breed is one commonly met with at Thebes in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, and is always painted with mottled or reddish markings over the white coat. Dogs of this type are not, however, seen in the modem Egyptian villages. Pet animals are frequently depicted under the chairs of their owners, and the tombs contain examples of dogs, cats, monkeys, gazelles, and even geese all shown in the same position."

    "description-of-plate": [
      "From the tomb of a 'Steward of the Vizier' showing the precise, careful work of the reign of Tuthmosis III. Part of a banqueting scene of which the setting is as follows: Amenemhet and his wife are seated on the left in front of a richly loaded table of provisions, offered by a son who stands opposite them with arm raised in the manner prescribed by the funerary ritual. Farther to the right, the scene divides into three registers, in the topmost of which the musicians occur. Behind them are male guests seated. The second register contains the female guests with serving-maids waiting upon them. The third register is devoted to attendants bearing unguents. There is little beauty in the present picture, which is reproduced merely as a good specimen of its subject and for the interest of the musical instruments. The harp played by the 'female singer Baket' rests partly on the ground, and partly against her shoulder. Her foot is doubled under her, and on her head is the lump of ointment for which the ancient Egyptians had so great a partiality. The open mouth indicates that Baket is singing, and the beginning of her song is written before her: 'Even as thou shine forth, so shine forth the faces of Amen-Rer.' (Probably addressed to the sun-god ; 'faces' is cryptic.) The lute-player does not handle his plectrum as though he were actually playing. His name is Amenemhet, and he sings, 'A happy day, spending a happy morn . . .'. A girl Ruiuresti, in the close-fitting dress of the period, plays the double pipes. Her song begins, 'Thou remainest great for ever, thou art united with eternity ...'. Note that the black has almost disappeared from her hair, leaving shadowy tresses and the original sketch-outline of the head. This picture should be compared with that in Plate XXXVII, where the musicians are all female."

      "This picture from the same tomb depicts one of several groups of animals or birds being fed by hand to fatten them for the prince's table. The standing man has been drawn with an attempt at perspective that is not wholly at fault; he is trying to force the oryx to lie down. His kneeling companion, whose name was Netjernakhti, has been badly distorted in the endeavor to reconcile what the artist saw with what he knew must be there. The animals, as usual, are far better drawn than the human beings, the horns in particular showing close observation of nature. The markings round the eyes, however, are rendered with a quaint convention. Oryxes are often represented in hunting scenes and sometimes figure with gazelles and ibexes in lists of provisions. In modem times they have almost disappeared from the deserts surrounding the Nile Valley, but in Ancient Egypt must have been common."
