It is also the earliest specimen of Egyptian pictorial art reproduced in the present work, and such is the mastery of its execution, such the craftsman's command of his materials, that it might well stand at the apex of the long centuries of achievement rather than at their base. The birds are closer to nature in their colouring than those of the later golden age of painting at Thebes, and for adequate comparison we must turn to the naturalistic art of El-Amarna (Plates LXXV, LXXVI). Similar processions of brown and grey geese, waddling along the canal banks of black mud fringed by the same variety of flowering rush, may be seen to-day by the wayfarer on the road from Giza to Medun; indeed, four of the geese might have been copied directly from their modem descendants. Three species are depicted, the White-fronted goose (Anser albifrons or erythropus, compare Plate VI), the Bean goose (Anser fabalis), and the Red\xad breasted goose (Branta ruficollis). Such at least was Nicoll's opinion, but it is not easy to follow his distinction of the former two. The Red-breasted goose is no longer found in Egypt, though recorded as having been seen there as recently as 1874; the present habitat is northern Siberia. The flowers of the rush are brownish-yellow in reality, not bright red as in the picture. Subtler shades are used than we find elsewhere in Egyptian painting. Black mixed with white has produced grey, and mixed with red has produced a dull pink. Black has also been combined with yellow and red to form a dark brown, while shading with fine lines adds new tones to the feathers. The stippling of light red on the legs has yielded a far brighter tint than if the color had been applied opaquely, as upon the breasts. Though treated conventionally, the geese exhibit all essential details, and it is astonishing to find such fidelity to nature in work anterior to the Pyramids and going back almost five thousand years. Nothing so accomplished is known from the same date beyond the borders of Egypt. That the Medum geese were not an entirely isolated tour deforce on the part of their author is shown by the fragment of a gazelle from the same tomb; this is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and is of extreme delicacy in both drawing and coloring. But hardly any other Old Kingdom site has produced paintings of comparable excellence.""]",['Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library ']

He is shown seated on the left and hidden by a screen made of reeds and pierced with peepholes at intervals. A portion of this screen comes into our excerpt, as well as an angle of the net (top right, enclosing two of the trapped ducks), and also the left edge of the water. The acacia tree here given balances another on the right side of the clap-net that has been reproduced in colour elsewhere. The tree in question is frequently seen in the villages and way-sides of Egypt; the modem Arabic name is sun/ , and it is popularly called 'mimosa' by Europeans. Here it is painted much more faithfully than in Plate XCVII (Dyn. XIX), and is shown flowering instead of seeding, the sweet-scented little yellow balls being distributed amongst the delicate pale-green foliage decoratively arranged around the brownish stems. The pale-yellow mid-rib of the leaf adds to the light effect of the whole. The birds which perch in the branches are such as are said to inhabit the sunt, and, like this, show a fairly close resemblance to nature. The hoopoe (Upttpa epops major) is common in Egypt to-day, but its tail is square and not forked as in the picture, and the crest is erect only in flight. The bird with spread wings and the one above it are both shrikes (Lanius nubicus). Next below is a Red-backed shrike (Lanius colurio), and standing under the tree on the right is a red\xad start (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), but with blue substituted for grey. These last species are rare at the present time, and are seldom depicted in the ancient paintings. At the bottom on the right ducks, still unsnared, swim about among the water-plants.\r\nThe whole composition is too large to admit of reproduction in its entirety.

The present picture comes from a series representing the work in Khnemhotpe’s orchards and vineyards. The artist has here, as in Plate VIII, produced sadly contorted forms in his endeavour to show the men with both shoulders. The fig-tree and baboons are much more satisfactorily rendered. It is unusual to find a genuine fig-tree instead of the sycamore commonly pictured in Egyptian paintings, but the artist has treated it as if it were quite familiar to him. The baboons have been held to be Cynocephalus babuin, but owing to the absence of the mane are possibly of the species Cynocephalus anubis, sometimes known from its colouring as the olive baboon, though this is now confined to West Africa. The animals are eating their fill, and were probably pets, as otherwise the men would hardly have submitted to such plundering. Nor is it likely that they then existed in Egypt in the wild state.

At the death of the queen, Senmut fell from power and his tomb seems to have been intentionally wrecked, so that hardly anything is now left of its scenes. The Plate shows in its present condition no small fraction of what remains. Much damage has been done by exposure to the weather, and the black locks, almost hanging to the waist, that were seen by the early copyists, have completely disappeared. An unsuccessful attempt by modem robbers to cut out some of the vases was fortunately abandoned in time. The small separate fragment comes from farther to the left, where the procession of tribute-bearers is continued under a frieze of Hathor-heads and a band of inscription. The beardless faces and red colour of the men are characteristic; no less than the richly ornamented skirts with their peculiar codpieces, elsewhere misinterpreted as quivers. It is impossible to tell whether these skirts were embroidered or woven in colours. The vases, absurdly exaggerated in size, raise many problems. If the two of the Vaphio type were of silver, as their colour seems to imply, how was the ornamentation upon them achieved? The purplish bands and scrolls on the one, and the bands and part of the oxen's heads on the other, were originally black, as some few remaining fragments show. For similar bucrania see Plate XXII. An inlay upon silver of yellow, blue, red, and black seems im\xadprobable, and one is tempted to believe that these cups represent painted pottery. But would painted pottery have been valuable enough to be depicted as tribute? To this question it might, how\xad ever, be answered that the two red vases certainly suggest earthen\xad ware both by their form and by their colour.

Part of a banqueting scene of which the setting is as follows: Amenemhet and his wife are seated on the left in front of a richly loaded table of provisions, offered by a son who stands opposite them with arm raised in the manner prescribed by the funerary ritual. Farther to the right, the scene divides into three registers, in the topmost of which the musicians occur. Behind them are male guests seated. The second register contains the female guests with serving-maids waiting upon them. The third register is devoted to attendants bearing unguents. There is little beauty in the present picture, which is reproduced merely as a good specimen of its subject and for the interest of the musical instruments. The harp played by the 'female singer Baket' rests partly on the ground, and partly against her shoulder. Her foot is doubled under her, and on her head is the lump of ointment for which the ancient Egyptians had so great a partiality. The open mouth indicates that Baket is singing, and the beginning of her song is written before her: 'Even as thou shine forth, so shine forth the faces of Amen-Rer.' (Probably addressed to the sun-god ; 'faces' is cryptic.) The lute-player does not handle his plectrum as though he were actually playing. His name is Amenemhet, and he sings, 'A happy day, spending a happy morn . . .'. A girl Ruiuresti, in the close-fitting dress of the period, plays the double pipes. Her song begins, 'Thou remainest great for ever, thou art united with eternity ...'. Note that the black has almost disappeared from her hair, leaving shadowy tresses and the original sketch-outline of the head. This picture should be compared with that in Plate XXXVII, where the musicians are all female.""]",['Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library ']

The standing man has been drawn with an attempt at perspective that is not wholly at fault; he is trying to force the oryx to lie down. His kneeling companion, whose name was Netjernakhti, has been badly distorted in the endeavor to reconcile what the artist saw with what he knew must be there. The animals, as usual, are far better drawn than the human beings, the horns in particular showing close observation of nature. The markings round the eyes, however, are rendered with a quaint convention. Oryxes are often represented in hunting scenes and sometimes figure with gazelles and ibexes in lists of provisions. In modem times they have almost disappeared from the deserts surrounding the Nile Valley, but in Ancient Egypt must have been common.""]",['Rare Books and Special Collections Digital Library ']
