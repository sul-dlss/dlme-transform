A title is written in a large square script at the top of the map: זאת אגרת מספרת יחסותא דתקיפי וצדיקי וחסידי ותנאי ואמוראי ארעא דישראל זכתום יעמד לנו ולכל ישראל ובא לציון גואל אכי״ר.

Ṣaddiq Sefardi's <i>The Epistle of the Number</i> was composed at the end of the 14th century after Isaac settled in Syracuse, Sicily, and this is the only known copy of the work. The Epistle is a translation and enlargement of the famous <i>Talḵīṣ ʿAmal al-Ḥisāb</i> ('A summary of the operations of calculation', 13th century) by the Moroccan Muslim mathematician Ibn al-Bannā ابن البنّاء‎ and it is especially notable in being the first known treatise in Hebrew to include extensive algebraic theories and operations. The Epistle attests novel mathematical vocabulary and enhances our linguistic understanding of the mechanisms that helped create the scientific vocabulary of Medieval Hebrew. The work proper begins on f.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/2'>1v</a>, with an explanation of how Isaac came to compose the Epistle. Book 1, arithmetical operations on integers, fractions and roots is on ff.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/2'>1v–25r</a>, and consists of three parts: part 1, arithmetical operations on integers; part 2, arithmetical operations on fractions; and part 3, arithmetical operations on the roots of expressible (rational) and inexpressible (irrational) quantities. Book 2, the rules which enable us to obtain the unknown from the given known, is on ff.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/53'>27r–38v</a>, and also consists of three parts: part 1, proportions and scales; part 2, the algebraic operations of restoration and operation; part 3, solution of problems of a practical nature by methods of algebra. The last words in part 3, on folio 38v, are 'another example', thus the manuscript is truncated. First words and headings are written in larger, bolder script; some words and the numerals in calculations are rubricated. There are tables with both Hebrew and Arabic numerals, as well as diagrams. There are occasional marginal calculations in a different hand, e.g., f.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/11'>6r</a>, as well as manicules, e.g., f.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/14'>7v</a>. Diagrams include the place-value numerical system with zero and Hindu-Arabic numerals, f.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/3'>2r</a>; various scales, ff.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/50'>25v–26v</a>; and multiplication tables of algebraic expressions, f.<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00492-00001/68'>34v</a>.

    "description": "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Nathan ben Joel Falaquera’s learned Hebrew compendium of medicine ‘Balm for the Body’. A theoretical treatise in the tradition of the great Arabic compendia, Falaquera’s compendium was divided into four parts (theoretical medicine; practical medicine; diseases; drugs) and prefaced with a philosophical discussion on the importance of the study of medicine. Its intention was to acquaint Jewish physicians with the knowledge of medicine available in the Arabic-speaking world (both Islamic and Classical sources). It appears to have been a popular work in the 14th and 15th centuries, with more than a dozen manuscripts from this period extant. This copy, in an Ashkenazi hand on 15th-century Italian paper, is missing substantial sections, however, and seems not to have been finished, breaking off midway through a page (mid-word, in fact) on f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/289'>145r</a>. It is, however, a particularly fine and large manuscript, in two columns with wide margins, with skilfully executed headings in red, green, blue and brown ink, foliage and scrollwork around chapter and section headings, as well as small pen illustrations (including pierced hearts, faces, poppies, bells) frequently brightening up the section numbers. The manuscript’s first three folios are missing, so it begins with the end of the table of contents (col. 1 on f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/9'>4r</a>) and continues with Nathan’s introduction and the first section on theoretical medicine (<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/9'>4r-46v</a>); this section closes on f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/92'>46v</a> with ובכאן נשלם החלק הראשון ועתה אתחיל החלק השני; the section on practical medicine follows (<a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/92'>46v-145r</a>) before breaking off.<br /><br /> The title of the work is written in a later square hand at the top of f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/9'>4r</a>, ספר צרי הגוף. Further marginal notes, corrections and additions in various hands can be found at f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/11'>5r</a> and rarely throughout the text, e.g., <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/129'>65r</a>. Where illuminated headings have been cut out of the manuscript, some traces remain, e.g., f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/25'>12r</a>. Many smaller illuminated headings have survived, e.g., f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/41'>21r</a>. Descenders on the lowest line of each column are often adorned with tiny illustrations, usually faces, e.g., <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/67'>34r</a>, <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/69'>35r</a> and <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00628/80'>40v</a>.

The stars of David (which occur occasionally at the end of books, for instance, at the end of Leviticus, f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00652/182'>89v</a>), seder and paraša markers in the Pentateuch are all gilded or rubricated. Other rubrics (e.g. the rubric noting the middle of a biblical book) are also treated decoratively (e.g., the micrographic lion at the end of the book of Daniel, f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00652/634'>315v</a>).<br /><br /> The word in the text to which masoretic notes refer is marked with two tiny supralinear dots, side by side. Omissions from the text are given by the naqdan (presumably) in the margin, using larger letters than the masora and marking them with a supralinear dot, for example לשרת at Exodus 39:26, f. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00652/136'>66v</a>. Crude taggim (‘crowns’) have been added to a number of letters in Genesis 1, including בראשית. These are probably not the work of the original scribe or naqdan. The pentateuchal text and non-poetic hagiographa are written throughout in 2 columns, with the exception of the poetical parts of the Torah, which are written either text over space (The Song of the Sea, Exodus 15:1-18, ff. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00652/97'>47r-v</a>) or space over space (The Song of Moses, Deuteronomy 32:1-43, ff. <a href='https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00652/290'>143v-144v</a>).<br /><br />Schiller-Szinessy (vol. i p. 24) writes: ‘The text is a model of beauty and correctness and in strict accordance with the מסרת.’ </p>",

Other rubrics (e.g. the rubric noting the middle of a biblical book) are also treated decoratively (e.g., the micrographic lion at the end of the book of Daniel, f. <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(634);return false;'>315v</a>).<br /><br /> The word in the text to which masoretic notes refer is marked with two tiny supralinear dots, side by side. Omissions from the text are given by the naqdan (presumably) in the margin, using larger letters than the masora and marking them with a supralinear dot, for example לשרת at Exodus 39:26, f. <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(136);return false;'>66v</a>. Crude taggim (‘crowns’) have been added to a number of letters in Genesis 1, including בראשית. These are probably not the work of the original scribe or naqdan. The pentateuchal text and non-poetic hagiographa are written throughout in 2 columns, with the exception of the poetical parts of the Torah, which are written either text over space (The Song of the Sea, Exodus 15:1-18, ff. <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(97);return false;'>47r-v</a>) or space over space (The Song of Moses, Deuteronomy 32:1-43, ff. <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(290);return false;'>143v-144v</a>).<br /><br />Schiller-Szinessy (vol. i p. 24) writes: ‘The text is a model of beauty and correctness and in strict accordance with the מסרת.’ </p>"
