Solomon is unenthusiastic to learn of a marriage that has recently taken place between Ibn al-ʿAmmānī and Solomon's paternal cousin, and he feels that Ibn al-ʿAmmānī has made the better match. Reference is made to a forthcoming marriage in the family, and greetings are sent to various individuals. From T-S 13J34.9 we learn that Solomon's cousin who married Hibatallāh b. Futūḥ Ibn al-ʿAmmānī was Sitt al-Yumn. This is possibly the same cousin Sitt al-Yumn that Solomon had unsuccessfully tried to marry himself in 1219 CE (T-S 13J18.22).</p>",
